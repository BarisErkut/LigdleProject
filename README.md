# LigdleProject
A solo web app development repo, it is called ligdle, a wordle-like football player guessing game.


Coded a web scraping program to gather the needed information into an excel file which I would use later for the database of the game.
(web-scraping.py) 

Initially, i thought of using node.js and MongoDB for developing the website but I had several troubles implementing the ideas, so I picked a different approach using Python's Django website development module. Since I plan this website to be a single page web app, the only file I should be really worry about is the actual html file and not the views.py or urls.py (mostly). Once I switched things became way easier. 

This is how the website looks currently, I plan on making the UI better at this point in the project. The functionality I wanted is mostly done, so I'm going to be working on the front-end stuff from now on.
