# LigdleProject
A solo web app development repo, it is called ligdle, a wordle-like football player guessing game.


Started of with making a really basic layout of the website using HTML,CSS. Didn't focus on any aesthetics because I wanted to create functionality first. This was enough to start putting javascript code in it.

Coded a web scraping program to gather the needed information into an excel file which I would use later for the database of the game.
